# RealTimeElectionQMS
There are three principal components of this project. BST, Heap, and Election. Election is a sample of a real-life problem where you have to handle certain queries related to election, say Vidhan Sabha Election occuring at multiple states of India at the same time. Binary search tree and binary max heap are used to handle those queries.
